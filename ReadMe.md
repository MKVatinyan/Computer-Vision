# Image processing subject exploration

I am exploring the large topic of computer vision, starting with basic image processing knowledge and moving up to high level techniques that will involve deep learning. The subjects are explored in notebooks and when an algorithm needs to be implemented it is done a script that can be called via the command line outside the notebook. The data folder contains data used in the notebooks and the md_images are images includes in the markdown files as illustrations.

For now i'm using resources from this repository : https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Computer_Vision

Currently there is code for :
* Low level vision
    * Colors and resizing
    * Histogram equalization
    * Filtering and edge detection
